# TriviaGame

## Overview: 
Create a timed trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Lay out this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

## Technology 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Comments
* Game logic was fairly straightforward. 


## Challenges
* I could not figure out how to diable the Next button if a player did not make any selections.

## Feedback and Questions
* Please comment on the general code structure. How can it be optimized and be made DRY?
* Should I be separate logic from DOM manupulations with jQuery? Otherwise, functions seem to be bloated.
